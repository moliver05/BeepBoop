### Specs

Returns a range of numbers from 0 to the chosen number with the following exceptions:

* 0 and all its divisible value = Beep!
* 1 and 10 = Boop!
* 3 and its divisible value = "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."

* These exceptions are written from least to most important.
* The first exception should apply unless the second exception does, and the same with the second and third.
* So, for example, in your finished program the number 10 should be replaced with "Boop!", and the number 30 should be replaced with "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."
* A user should be able to enter a new number and see new results over and over again.
